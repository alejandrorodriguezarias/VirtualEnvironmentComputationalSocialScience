# SEGAR: Social Environment Generator for Agent-based Research
 This repository contains a tool that facilitates the creation of a virtual environment for the development of agent-based models, especially in the context of computational social sciences. It uses as a base data from the census sections of the city and allows to load other relevant data such as the location of schools, universities, stores, etc.

It is fully compatible and intended to be used together with the Agent-Based Modelling Framework for Unity3d (ABMU) (URL).
## Installation
### From Github
Clone this repository and open it in the Unity Editor.
### As Unity Package
Work in progress
## Examples
* Basic example: A Coruña with supermarkets. To see this example you have to enter the A Coruña scene. In this scene the program simply loads the census tracts, generates empty agents distributed in the census tracts following the socio-demographic data, and adds the supermarkets of the city as relevant places.
